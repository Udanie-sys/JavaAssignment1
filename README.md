Q A.1.a Can you implement the sing() method for the bird?

Sing() is not defined in type Bird.
To implement the sing() method, we have to define the sing method in Bird class or Animal class

Q A.1.b How did you optimize the code for maintainability?
We can use interface to improve the maintainability. We can create seperateinterfaces for fly() and sing(). So that the birds who can fly can implement the interface.

Q A.2 Now, we have 2 special kinds of birds: the Duck and the Chicken... Can you
implement them to make their own special sound?

2.a,2.b,2.c,2.d answers are available in the solution class and respective test classes (qanoe,qatwo,qathree,qafour)

Q A.3 Now how would you model a rooster?

3.a,3.b,3.c answers are available in solution class and test class.

Q A.4d How do you keep the parrot maintainable? What if we need another parrot
lives near a Duck? Or near a phone that rings frequently?

Used composition (has-a relationship with cat,dog,duck and rooster.) with abstraction to implement this
  
Q B. Model fish as well as other swimming animals.

Answer is available in the solution class (qb)

Q D.Can you optimize your model to account for the metamorphosis from caterpillar to
butterfly?

yes (qd)

Q E. Can you share the code to count?

Answer is available in the solution class (qe).
